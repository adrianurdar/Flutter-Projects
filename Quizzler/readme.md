# Quizzler ‚ùì

A mobile quiz app that tests your general knowledge. As one of the most popular types of apps on the app stores, I created my own quiz for other people to enjoy!

## What I've used

- Modularising my code into separate classes.
- Dart classes and objects.
- Using class constructors.
- Extracting Widgets to refactor my code.
- Private and public modifiers in Dart.
- Dart lists.
- The difference between var, const and final.
